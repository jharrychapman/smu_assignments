I trained a logistic regression, random forest, SVC, and GridSearchCV model on the exoplanet data. From the results of each test set, I generated a chart to compare the accuracy score of each respective model. In order of accuracy, random forest performed the best (0.892), followed by grid search (0.871), SVC (0.832), and finally logistic regression (0.830). Based on these accuracy values, I beleive random forest could be an adequate first assessment to determine if potential new exoplanets are worth exploring further. In the future, I may try XGBoost or increase the number of n_estimators for the random forest.
