                    <h2>Socioeconomic Correlations</h2>
                    <p>Examining state-level data, the upward trend of poverty (%) and lack of healthcare (%) signifies that there is a higher prevalence of those without healthcare as
                        the percentage of those in poverty increases.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>Comparing age with lack of healthcare, we can see there is a weak negative correlation between age and lack of healthcare, with increasing age correlating
                        with lower levels of lack of healthcare. However, this weak correlation is drawn largely by the outliers of TX, UT, ME, VT, and MA.
            
                    <p>
                        The correlation between median household income and lack of healthcare is more strongly negative and is fundamentally the inverse of the first correlation (Poverty x Lack of Healthcare)
                        so the results are expected: higher median household incomes correlate with higher levels of healthcare coverage (or lower levels of lack of healthcare coverage).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Moreover, both smoking (%) and obesity (%) are positively correlated with higher levels of poverty while they are basically uncorrelated with trends in age
                        and are centered around 37-38 years. Is this due to smokers and the obese dying sooner? More analysis is needed to support this hypothesis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, both smoking (%) and obesity (%) are negatively correlated with median household income. That is, higher levels of wealth see lower prevalance in the proportions
                        of smokers and the obese. Could this be due to different access to healthcare, nutrition, and education across the income spectrum?
